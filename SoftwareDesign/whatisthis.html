<h2 align="center">Th simulator takes you into a not so distant future where nano bots are the most effective form of cancer treatment. In this environment cells must seek food in order to survive and pass on their genetic code. However the nanobots are on constant surveilance and will destroy any cell that their scanners pick up as cancerous.</h2>

    <h2 align="center">The cells only purpose in life is to eat and mate. It seeks for a mate once its nice and full but if it fails to consume enough food, it will die of starvation. Every cell has its DNA code and upon mating it passes on half of his genetic code and half of its partners code. By clicking on the cell you can see its current mate aswell as its DNA strand. </h2>

    <h2 align="center">This is the primary source of energy for the cell. It must consume this molecule if it wishes to survive and mate.</h2>

    <h2 align="center">If the T-800 was a Nano Bot this would be it. It only has two operating mode: Seek and DESTROY. When it passes a cell it scans it DNA and if its cancerous it terminates it as swiftly as possible</h2>
